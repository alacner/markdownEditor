{"name":"MarkdownEditor","body":"# Yet Another Markdown Editor\r\nThis is another markdown editor that is based on Showdown, but **NOT** on WMD. The idea is to make a lightweight, jQuery-based editor with most of the features but none of the baggage. The result is an uncompressed 8KB file.\r\n\r\nThe simplest example of use:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$('.container').markdownEditor({\r\n  value: '##Yet Another Markdown Editor##\\n\\n' +\r\n    'This is another markdown editor that is based on Showdown, but **NOT** on WMD'\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n* All the typical buttons are there: bold, italics, etc.\r\n* Undo and redo\r\n* Keyboard shortcuts\r\n* Internationalized button (hover) titles\r\n\r\n## The options\r\n\r\nThey are not that many:\r\n\r\n* **historyRate**: the number of milliseconds to introduce entries in the \"undo\" registry. If the user starts writing, it will wait this amount of time before introducing a new entry in the history. Default is 2000.\r\n* **renderRate**: the same concept applied to rendering preview HTML. The default is 300.\r\n* **buttons**: the list of buttons to display. The default is `[ 'b', 'i', 'a', 'blockquote', 'pre', 'img', 'h', 'ol', 'ul', 'undo', 'redo', 'help' ]`\r\n* **resources**: the list of labels to use, in case you need i18n.\r\n\r\n## Bugs\r\n\r\nA'plenty. But we are using it for a real site, and so far are quite happy.","tagline":"A jQuery-based markdown javascript editor","google":"UA-3159223-4","note":"Don't delete this file!
